## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Reset

### What I learned

I'm using Frontend Mentor to brush up and add to my HTML/CSS knowledge using real-world examples.

### Useful resources

- [Piccalilli Blog CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - For my last Frontend Mentor challenge the community suggested me to use a CSS Reset. It's probably a bit 'overkill' for such a small project but I might as well get used to using one.
